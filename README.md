Project Overview:

Over the past year, Apple has expanded its digital marketing and content initiatives, featuring product launches (iPhone 16, Apple Watch Ultra 2, M3 MacBook Air), sustainability campaigns, and innovation highlights. The company invests heavily in storytelling-driven content to:

● Strengthen Apple’s global brand identity
● Increase customer engagement and advocacy
● Drive awareness of new product innovations
● Maximize ROI from digital ad and influencer campaigns

However, Apple’s marketing team faces challenges aligning content performance with business outcomes. They want clarity on:
● Which type of content and campaigns resonate most with Apple’s audience?
● How ad spend and campaign engagement contribute to ROI?
● How launches (e.g., iPhone event) affect follower growth and engagement?
● What content strategy sustains customer loyalty and brand advocacy?

Project Objectives I have delivered:
I have built a Social Media Intelligence Solution in Excel that consolidates Apple’s raw data into actionable business insights.Your analysis should help Apple’s digital marketing team make data-driven decisions for improving campaign performance, engagement, and platform strategy.
